In the description we see an encryption with the name - onetime pad https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cryptography_with_python/cryptography_with_python_one_time_pad_cipher.htm
In this kind of encryption we use a key with the same size or longer of the plaintext that we want to encrypt. So is kind of Vigen√®re Cipher but the different is that for any letter we have a special shift.
For example we have a msg with 10 letters like "plain text" so we need to execute 26^10 possibilities to find the plaintext.

The is vulnerability in this encrpytion if the plaintext is small or there is reused of the key.
In our challenge we can see 11 lines of numbers. Maybe each line is a cipher text and each line encrypted with the same key.

We will use the tool crib drag to check that. https://github.com/SpiderLabs/cribdrag
We know that part of the key is ALEXCTF{ is a good start.
